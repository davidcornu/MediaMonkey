# This is an example configuration file for MediaMonkey

# Thumbnails Configuration
# - Defines which thumbnails are generated for each of 
#   the image files you upload. 
# - Each size can take any of the command line options 
#   for Graphics Magick's convert utility.
# - The size names will be appended to the file name
#
# For more information about those options please see
# http://www.graphicsmagick.org/convert.html#conv-opti
#
# This configuration will resize images to fit within
# at least one of the bounds, and crop at the center.

# If set to true, MediaMonkey will keep the original image

# If set to true, MediaMonkey will use the original filename
# as the basis for all other names. The default behavior is to
# use a hash as the file name, prepended by the size.

# If set to a string, MediaMonkey will block all uploads that
# do not include this token under the 'token' parameter. This

# routeable, which isn't recommended.

# If set to true, MediaMonkey will generate a manifest.json
# file in each of the directories containing uploaded files
# listing the files available. This is very querying a database
